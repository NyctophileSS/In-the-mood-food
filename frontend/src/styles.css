/*
To-Do: 
Make input boxes larger
Turn "Start munchin'" and "Register" into actual buttons
Make them match the size and style of the other forms but have the purple background color
Find a good background picture like graham suggested
(Background: Outlines of food. I could edit it to make it work if the colors are wrong)
Add tiny images to username/password (look at the first example screenshot I sent)
Add a small forgot password under Start munchin'
Make the small forgot password match the slightly gray text of the forms
An easy way to do is it to make it a button but change how it looks so it has no background
Test on an actual phone, fix scaling and spacing as appropriate to make the login page fit on a screen
ATTEMPT to make the register page fit on a screen without needing to scroll
